Hello, this is a readme.

So far, this project is just a positioning tool.
It was originally meant for positioning objects relative to a perspective
camera, but it can really work for any two objects.. and I'll likely develop
it further along in that direction.  
I also want to add a way to specify the exact pixels on the screen. I think that
can be super helpful for more precise things.
